# Program Interpretability

Below you will find several examples of malignant and benign patches as well as the predictions made by the top 3 models based on validation accuracy across the 100 MAGE runs.

The model interpreted in the paper correspond to the "Third best model". 

## Malignant Example 1 
![Example 1 of a malignant patch]("sup/interpretability/malignant/chosen_malignant_750.png")

### Best model 

![Prediction made by the Best model (TP)]("sup/interpretability/malignant/model1_750.png")

### Second best model 

![Prediction made by the second best model (FN)]("sup/interpretability/malignant/model2_750.png")

### Third best model 

![Prediction made by the third best model (TP)]("sup/interpretability/malignant/model3_750.png")

## Malignant Example 2 

![Example 2 of a malignant patch]("sup/interpretability/malignant/chosen_malignant_45.png")

### Best model 

![Prediction made by the best model (TP)]("sup/interpretability/malignant/model1_45.png")

### Second best model

### Third best model

## Malignant Example 3 

![Example 3 of a malignant patch]("sup/interpretability/malignant/chosen_malignant_909.png")

### Best model 
![Prediction made by the best model (TP)]("sup/interpretability/malignant/model1_909.png")

### Second best model

### Third best model

## Benign Example 1 
![Example 1 of a benign patch]("sup/interpretability/benign/chosen_benign_602.png")

### Best model 
![Prediction made by the best model (TN)]("sup/interpretability/benign/model1_602.png")

### Second best model 

![Prediction made by the second best model (TN)]("sup/interpretability/benign/model2_602.png")

### Third best model 

![Prediction made by the third best model (TN)]("sup/interpretability/benign/model3_602.png")



## Benign Example 2 

![Example 2 of a benign patch]("sup/interpretability/benign/chosen_benign_865.png")

### Best model 
![Prediction made by the best model (TN)]("sup/interpretability/benign/model1_865.png")

### Second best model 
![Prediction made by the second best model (TN)]("sup/interpretability/benign/model2_865.png")

### Third best model 

This is an example of the overflowing by "fastscanning", explained in the paper, because of previous numerous nuclei edges detected. Hence, the support for malignancy is lower than the support for benign.

## Benign Example 3 

![Example 3 of a benign patch]("sup/interpretability/benign/chosen_benign_394.png")

In this case all models produced wrong predictions.

### Second best model

### Third best model
